# PortafolioWebOrquestador

In our microservice architecture we wanted to try orchestration instead of choreagraphy so we created an Orcherstrator! This service sits in the middle between all the apps we developed and the 3 microservices of the core functionalities. It handles all the REST style HTTP requests and forwards the data to the correct microservice while also checking the JWT Authorization token!
